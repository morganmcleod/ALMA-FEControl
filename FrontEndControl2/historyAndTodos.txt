  that the data was written to the bus before proceeding.  Previously didn't think this was needed
  but now troubleshooting intermittent AMBSI1 timeout/lockup problem.
Fix: Fine LO sweep was using SIS voltage and current setting from the INI file rather than from
  the front panel.  This got broken in 2.2.9.

2.2.9-fix5 2011-02-24
Fix: ThermalLog output file had swapped headers ('gate valve' and 'solenoid valve'.)  Thanks JP!
Fix: HealthCheck logging for CPDS had extra freqLO column.
Fix: logMonitors output for CPDS had 24V voltage twice and no 24V current. 

2.2.9-fix4 2011-02-17
MixerDeflux process: Uses the nominal magnet current settings from the configuration file when
  setting the magnets at the end of demagnetization/defluxing.

2.2.9-fix3 2011-02-16
MixerHeating process:  Simplified loop.  No longer logging to FELOG inside loop.  20 ms loop delay.
MixerHeating process:  Makes sure that SIS magnets are off before heating.  
  Alert: does not return magnets to prior state after heating.  The MixerDeflux process will take care of
  that when it uses the MixerHeating routine.  When it is used stand-alone there is no safe way to
  re-enable the magnets after heating without adding a delay for the mixer temps to come back down.

2.2.9-fix2 2011-02-16
MixerHeating process:  Adjustments to loop timing.   Now 100 ms delay in outer loop after enabling
  heater and no delay in inner loop.

2.2.9-fix1 2011-02-15
Cartridge configuration gets written out to log file at the start of cartridge health check mode.
MixerHeating process:  Loop delay is now 25 ms instead of 100 to allow more granularity and time for 
  logging statements to print.
MixerDeflux: Perform MixerHeating with default target temperature and timeout after demagnetization. 
  This is followed by a pause of 2 seconds for band 9 and one minute for bands 678 to allow mixer temperatures 
  to return to normal.  Finally the magnet current is swept to nominal+10%, to 0, back to nominal.  
MixerDeflux: Fix bug where LO PA state was not being returned to prior value in cases where the PA was already
  off prior to starting the procedure.
MixerDeflux: Fixed (?) progress bar behavior.
Measure SIS current vs. magnet current:  At the end of a scan, sweep the magnet current down to 0 
  then back up to the prior/nominal value.  After this, sweep the SIS current up to nominal.

2.2.9 2011-02-03
Added detailed control of mixer heating process to the LabView interface.
ESNs are now displayed in the opposite byte order from previously, but in line with the majority of component builders.
Added FE and cartridge health check functions.

Removed logFile, logFileReplace, LogMySQL, and saveConfigToIniFile options from configuration file.
All bias settings are echoed to log file with fixed precision -- easier to read.
correctSISVoltageError is now enabled by default.

2.2.7 2010-11-17
Support for stand-alone FEMC module and signal source (BeaSTS).
All optimize and I-V curve operations now have a stop button.
CryostatPumping process:  Close the solenoid valve and turbo pump, even when gate valve fails to close.
Added subscribeForEvents to FEControl Init and Shutdown.
Fix: Flush log stream before deleting it at shutdown.  Some final entries were getting lost.
Fix: Bias values in logs now given in fixed point.

Increased averaging when monitoring SIS current.
Bug fix affecting band 7 mixer heating.
Refactored FrontEndAMBLib to support ICD unit test suite.
Default config file includes warm bias values for bands 4 & 8.

2.2.5.fix2 2010-03-05

All monitor points may be optionally dumped to the log with logMonitors=1 in config file.
The order in which analog monitor points are read can be randomized.
SIS and magnet monitor values are now returned even when not biased.
CPDS monitors are now returned even when cartridge is off.
Changed PLL monitoring to get real-time values for key lock monitor points.
LORTM accounts for FLOOG offset when setting output frequencies.  WCA does not.
Made LORTM reference laser frequency configurable. 
Bugfix: workaround for LORTM ambient temp sensor bytes in wrong order.
Bugfix: GCC & std.lib. 3.4.5 fixes logging-related crash.
Bugfix: LORTM error reporting.

2.2.4 2009-12-01
Removed monitor point for SIS heater enable because was removed from FE-Computing ICD.
Removed FLOOG offset calculation from LORTM locking; was causing LORTM to lock 30 MHz away from nominal LO ref.
(But this needs to be put back... the FLOOG offset should be applied to the LORTM, not the LO!)
Added delays to LO locking algorithm to account for YTO slewing specs, based on comments from Eric Bryerton.
Extended timeout waiting for power meter readings while optimizing.
Added methods required for image rejection measurement:  
- Get LO PA drain voltage setting
- Set LO PA drain voltage as a percentage of maximum
- Enable/disable WCA LO Output
- Added cartGetLocked method to query the lock status from LabVIEW.

2.2.3.fix2
Fix timing bugs in LORTM methods to get status. 

2.2.3.fix1 2009-09-08
IV curve log file now named for pol and sb.

Save Window screens are now written to logDir;  removed path control from GUI.
Cartridge state control buttons (enabled, observing, SIS, etc.) are initialized to the actual state of the hardware. 
Mixer heater operation now logs temperatures and currents to logDir.
I-V Curve now writes both the set and readback values for Vbias to its output file.
Fixed bug where PLL addjust was not being performed after successful lock.
Fixed bug where mixer deflux would not measure heater current during heating.
Reading of SIS voltage and current both support averaging and printing data points to the FE log.

Added separate executable for chopper and signal generator test programs.
Added status bar and status message history dialog.
Added fine LO stepping measurement, replacing cartStepMeasureLOPowerAmps (introduced in 2.2.0.)
Fixed thermal logging which was broken somewhere along the way.   Now it is always on and sent to logDir.
Added PA Adjust function to Band 3.  This will be useful when characterizing several WCAs with a single cold cartridge.

2.2.1 2009-06-09
Improved error messages when unable to connect to FE, power meters, or chopper.
Failure to connect to power meters does not prevent use of chopper.

Added power meter readouts page.
Integrated control of the power meter and the chopper.
Added check for successful connection to the front end on startup (not working well yet.)
Added cartStepMeasureLOPowerAmps method.  This is a special diagnostic method not for normal use:  
- Steps the YTO and adjusts the PA drain voltage to hold the mixer current constant.
Refactored/simplified optimization and measurement routines.
Log now goes to a specified directory and is named automatically with the date and time.
I-V curve and optimization-related measurements create a data file in the log directory.

2.1.9 2009-03-06
Reduced NICAN queue sizes so that CAN0 and CAN1 can both be used at once.
Fixed bug where optimizing the LO power amp could stop short due to unsteady junciton current readings.
- It now averages three current readings at each step.

Fixed annoyance where Zero Integrator gets turned off whenever LO frequency is set.
Fixed library+GUI bugs in manual setting magnet current.
Fixed GUI bug in manual setting junction voltage.

Band 3 optimization:  added chart, software now sets power meters to Watts.

2.1.6 2008-08-15
Fixed bug which gave bad data when reading INI file.
Added support for operating WCA and CC with no CPDS (CPDS=0 in INI file.)
Useful if external power supplies are used instead of CPDS.  

2.1.5 2008-07-22
Simplified CAN & SocketClient send/receive queue code.  
I belive the crash bug was lurking there but I did not find the exact bug mechanism.

2.1.4 2008-06-25
Changes to SIS/Magnet GUI screens.
Added controls for manual setting of magnet current.
Converted adjustVJVD function into separate setVJVD and getVJVD funcs.

2.1.3 2008-06-20:
Fixed(?) multi-threaded logging issues causing crashes, especially when optimizing PA drive.
Added INI file control of SIS open/closed loop. 
[Note added 2008-07-22]:  Crash bug is not fixed in this version.

2.1.2 2008-06-12: 
Fixed bugs found while operating in Chile.
Removed 'queryCartridgeState' action on startup -- was causeing EU & EA systems to freeze.
Consequence of this is that the software does not show which cartridges are on and biased at startup.

2.1.1 2008-05-15: 
Added socket client capability.  Needs testing and debugging.
Made configuration from INI file the default, rather than config from database.
